Write a SQL query to get the nth highest salary from the Employee table.
+----+--------+
| Id | Salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
For example, given the above Employee table, the nth highest salary where n = 2 is 200. If there is no nth highest salary, then the query should return null.

+------------------------+
| getNthHighestSalary(2) |
+------------------------+
| 200                    |
+------------------------+


Solution:
# Write your MySQL query statement below:
CREATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(N INT) RETURNS INT
BEGIN
    SET N = N - 1;
    RETURN (
            SELECT DISTINCT Salary
            FROM Employee
            ORDER BY Salary DESC
            LIMIT N, 1
    );
END

/* Write your T-SQL query statement below: */
CREATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(@N INT) RETURNS INT AS
BEGIN
    RETURN (
        SELECT TOP 1 Salary
        FROM (SELECT Salary, DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY Salary DESC) AS sal_rank
              FROM Employee) sub
        WHERE sub.sal_rank = @N
    );
END

/* Write your PL/SQL query statement below */
CREATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(N IN NUMBER) RETURN NUMBER IS
result NUMBER;
BEGIN
    SELECT MAX(Salary) INTO result
    FROM (SELECT Salary, DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY Salary DESC) AS sal_rank
          FROM Employee) sub
    WHERE sub.sal_rank = N;

    RETURN result;
END;
