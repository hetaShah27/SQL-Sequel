SQL Schema
In facebook, there is a follow table with two columns: followee, follower.

Please write a sql query to get the amount of each followerâ€™s follower if he/she has one.

For example:
Create table If Not Exists follow (followee varchar(255), follower varchar(255))
Truncate table follow
insert into follow (followee, follower) values ('A', 'B')
insert into follow (followee, follower) values ('B', 'C')
insert into follow (followee, follower) values ('B', 'D')
insert into follow (followee, follower) values ('D', 'E')
+-------------+------------+
| followee    | follower   |
+-------------+------------+
|     A       |     B      |
|     B       |     C      |
|     B       |     D      |
|     D       |     E      |
+-------------+------------+

should output:
+-------------+------------+
| follower    | num        |
+-------------+------------+
|     B       |  2         |
|     D       |  1         |
+-------------+------------+
Explaination:
Both B and D exist in the follower list, when as a followee, B's follower is C and D, and D's follower is E. A does not exist in follower list.

Note:
Followee would not follow himself/herself in all cases.
Please display the result in follower's alphabet order.


Solution:
/* MySQL query for MySQL, T-SQL query for MS SQL Server, PL/SQL query for Oracle: */
SELECT followee AS follower, COUNT(DISTINCT follower) AS num
FROM follow
WHERE followee IN (SELECT follower
                    FROM follow)
GROUP BY followee
ORDER BY followee;
