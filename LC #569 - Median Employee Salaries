SQL Schema
The Employee table holds all employees. The employee table has three columns: Employee Id, Company Name, and Salary.
Create table If Not Exists Employee (Id int, Company varchar(255), Salary int)
Truncate table Employee
insert into Employee (Id, Company, Salary) values ('1', 'A', '2341')
insert into Employee (Id, Company, Salary) values ('2', 'A', '341')
insert into Employee (Id, Company, Salary) values ('3', 'A', '15')
insert into Employee (Id, Company, Salary) values ('4', 'A', '15314')
insert into Employee (Id, Company, Salary) values ('5', 'A', '451')
insert into Employee (Id, Company, Salary) values ('6', 'A', '513')
insert into Employee (Id, Company, Salary) values ('7', 'B', '15')
insert into Employee (Id, Company, Salary) values ('8', 'B', '13')
insert into Employee (Id, Company, Salary) values ('9', 'B', '1154')
insert into Employee (Id, Company, Salary) values ('10', 'B', '1345')
insert into Employee (Id, Company, Salary) values ('11', 'B', '1221')
insert into Employee (Id, Company, Salary) values ('12', 'B', '234')
insert into Employee (Id, Company, Salary) values ('13', 'C', '2345')

insert into Employee (Id, Company, Salary) values ('15', 'C', '2645')
insert into Employee (Id, Company, Salary) values ('16', 'C', '2652')

Write a SQL query to find the median salary of each company. Bonus points if you can solve it without using any built-in SQL functions.

Solution:
/* MySQL query for MySQL, T-SQL query for MS SQL Server: */
SELECT sub.Id, sub.Company, sub.Salary
FROM (SELECT Id, Company, Salary,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY Company ORDER BY Salary) AS row_num,
        COUNT(Id) OVER (PARTITION BY Company) AS emp_count
        FROM Employee) sub
WHERE (sub.emp_count%2 = 0 AND sub.row_num IN (sub.emp_count/2, 1+sub.emp_count/2)) OR (sub.emp_count%2 = 1 AND sub.row_num = (sub.emp_count + 1)/2);

/* PL/SQL query for Oracle: */
SELECT sub.Id, sub.Company, sub.Salary
FROM (SELECT Id, Company, Salary,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY Company ORDER BY Salary) AS row_num,
        COUNT(Id) OVER (PARTITION BY Company) AS emp_count
        FROM Employee) sub
WHERE sub.row_num IN (CEIL(sub.emp_count/2), sub.emp_count/2+1);
