SQL Schema
Table my_numbers contains many numbers in column num including duplicated ones.
Can you write a SQL query to find the biggest number, which only appears once.
Create table If Not Exists my_numbers (num int)
Truncate table my_numbers
insert into my_numbers (num) values ('8')
insert into my_numbers (num) values ('8')
insert into my_numbers (num) values ('3')
insert into my_numbers (num) values ('3')
insert into my_numbers (num) values ('1')
insert into my_numbers (num) values ('4')
insert into my_numbers (num) values ('5')
insert into my_numbers (num) values ('6')
+---+
|num|
+---+
| 8 |
| 8 |
| 3 |
| 3 |
| 1 |
| 4 |
| 5 |
| 6 | 

For the sample data above, your query should return the following result:
+---+
|num|
+---+
| 6 |
Note: If there is no such number, just output null.


Solution:
/* MySQL query for MySQL, T-SQL query for MS SQL Server, PL/SQL query for Oracle: */
SELECT MAX(sub.num) AS num
FROM (SELECT num
        FROM my_numbers
        GROUP BY num
        HAVING COUNT(num) = 1) sub;
