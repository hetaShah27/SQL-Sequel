SQL Schema
Table point holds the x coordinate of some points on x-axis in a plane, which are all integers.

Write a query to find the shortest distance between two points in these points.
CREATE TABLE If Not Exists point (x INT NOT NULL, UNIQUE INDEX x_UNIQUE (x ASC))
Truncate table point
insert into point (x) values ('-1')
insert into point (x) values ('0')
insert into point (x) values ('2')
| x   |
|-----|
| -1  |
| 0   |
| 2   |

The shortest distance is '1' obviously, which is from point '-1' to '0'. So the output is as below:
| shortest|
|---------|
| 1       |

Note: Every point is unique, which means there is no duplicates in table point. 

Follow-up: What if all these points have an id and are arranged from the left most to the right most of x axis?


Solution:
/* MySQL query for MySQL, T-SQL query for MS SQL Server, PL/SQL query for Oracle: */
SELECT MIN(ABS(x-sub.x2)) AS shortest
FROM (SELECT x, LEAD(x,1) OVER (ORDER BY x) AS x2
        FROM point) sub
WHERE sub.x2 IS NOT NULL;

Following is another solution without using Window functions:
SELECT MIN(ABS(p1.x-p2.x)) AS shortest
FROM point p1
JOIN point p2
WHERE p1.x != p2.x;
